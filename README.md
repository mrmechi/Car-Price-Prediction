# Car-Price-Prediction

# Intoduction
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. 
Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. In this project I have built a car price prediction model with machine learning using Python.
This project aims to predict the Price of an used Car by taking other parameters, the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.
It then predicts the possible price of the car.

# Approach
1. Data Loading using Pandas
2. Data Cleaning using Pandas
3. Data Preprocessing using Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
4. Creating the Linear Regression Model
5. Spliting the dataset into Train and Test to avoid overfitting.
6. Training the data.
7. Predictions from the test data.
9. Saving the ML model using pickle.
9. Creating the application using Flask, html, javascript, css and bootstrap.
10. Loading the modle into our application.

# Conclusion
Just my passing parameters like Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven we can predict the Price of the car.
